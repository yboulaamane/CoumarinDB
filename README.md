# CoumarinDB

Coumarin is considered a versatile and privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry. In the recent decades, a large number of natural products containing the coumarin scaffold have been isolated and identified from natural resources. The literature shows that coumarin derivatives display a wide spectrum of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxydant, anticoagulant, antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties. For this reason, CoumarinDB was created to collect chemical information about naturally occuring coumarins in an effort to cope with the increasing available data and to speed up the drug discovery process from natural products.
